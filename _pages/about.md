Hello there! 

I am currently working towards my [Ph.D. in Computer Science](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg){:target="\_blank"} at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg){:target="\_blank"} working under the supervision of Dr. Niranjan Nagarajan and Prof. Wong Limsoon. I'm conducting my research at the [Nagarajan Lab](https://csb5.github.io){:target="\_blank"}, [Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/gis){:target="\_blank"}. 

Before that, I obtained my Master of Biophysics (Visual Neuroscience) from the [Federal University of Rio de Janeiro](https://biof.ufrj.br/en){:target="\_blank"}. I have previous experiences as Software Engineer in the industry and also earned a Technologist's degree in Systems Analysis and Development (former Information Technology).
